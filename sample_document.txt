Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines information retrieval with generative AI models. 

RAG works by first retrieving relevant documents or passages from a knowledge base, and then using those retrieved contexts to inform a language model's response. This approach allows AI systems to access up-to-date information and cite specific sources.

The typical RAG pipeline consists of several key steps:
1. Document ingestion: Raw documents are processed and split into smaller chunks
2. Embedding generation: Each chunk is converted into a vector embedding using an embedding model
3. Vector storage: Embeddings are stored in a vector database for efficient similarity search
4. Query processing: When a question is asked, it is also converted to an embedding
5. Retrieval: The most similar document chunks are retrieved based on vector similarity
6. Generation: The retrieved context is passed to a language model along with the query to generate an answer

RAG systems are particularly useful because they can:
- Access external knowledge without retraining the model
- Provide citations and traceability for answers
- Handle domain-specific information effectively
- Reduce hallucinations by grounding responses in retrieved documents

Common vector databases used in RAG include ChromaDB, Pinecone, Weaviate, and FAISS. ChromaDB is a popular choice for local development because it's lightweight, easy to use, and doesn't require external API keys.

Embedding models like sentence-transformers provide high-quality vector representations of text. Popular models include all-MiniLM-L6-v2, all-mpnet-base-v2, and multilingual models for non-English text.

The quality of a RAG system depends on several factors:
- Chunk size and overlap strategy
- Embedding model selection
- Number of retrieved documents (top-k)
- Prompt engineering for the generation step
- Re-ranking strategies for better relevance

RAG has been successfully applied to chatbots, question-answering systems, document analysis tools, and knowledge management applications.
